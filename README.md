# Digit Recognition using MNIST dataset in Python
This repository contains the code for training a model for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset in Python. The model is implemented using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and is trained on the training data from the MNIST dataset.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Keras
Tensorflow
Numpy
Matplotlib

## Usage
To run the code, simply clone the repository and open the notebook with JupyterLab or JupyterNotebook
 
## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 99% on the train dataset and 98% on the validation dataset, indicating a high level of performance in predicting the correct output.

## Note
This is a simple version of the model and it is further improved by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), increasing the number of neurons, and using other preprocessing techniques. That model is submitted and achieved 99.3% accuracy in Kaggle.
